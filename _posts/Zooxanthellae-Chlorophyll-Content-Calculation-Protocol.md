# Protocol for Calculation of Chlorophyll Content of Zooxanthellae
### Lab Equipment
* Spectrophotometer with cuvettes
* 5mL micropipette and tips
* Pure acetone
* Centrifuge
* 5mL centrifuge tubes
* Vortex

#### Procedure:

**Part 1: Tissue Removal and Separation of Zooxanthellae**
These steps were completed in the protocol for adult coral zooxanthellae counts (->)

**Part 2: Chlorophyll Extraction (to be completed in indirect light)**
Add 5mL of pure acetone to 5mL centrifuge tubes containing zooxanthellae pellet
Vortex the tube
Allow samples to sit in darkness, refrigerated for 24 hours
Covering tubes in aluminum foil is recommended to ensure darkness

**Part 3: Measuring Absorbance**
In indirect light -
Re-vortex the tube and then centrifuge on high for 4 minutes
Cover the tubes again with aluminum to ensure darkness
Zero the spectrophotometer using acetone blank
Transfer zooxanthellae samples from centrifuge tubes to glass cuvettes
Record absorbance at 750, 663, and 630nm
Multiply trials recommended for each sample to ensure correct reading

**Part 4: Calculation of Chlorophyll Content**
Subtract the value read at 750nm from the other two reading values in order to correct the values for phaeopigments
Calculate the content in each cuvette sample for chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2 using these equations:
Chlorophyll a = 11.43 E663-0.64 E630 Chlorophyll c2 = 27.09 E630-3.63 E663
(E = absorbance)
The pigment amount for each sample can be calculated using: µg pigment = C * volume acetone * (volume of blastate/volume of sub-sample)
The volume of blastate was recorded during the aforementioned adult coral zooxanthellae count protocol
The volume of sub-sample is the volume of the centrifuge tube (5mL)
This calculation can be done for solely chlorophyll a, solely cholrophyll c2 or for the sum of the two
µg can then be divided by the number of zooxanthellae calculated in the previous protocol (as long as it is from the same sample) to give µg chlorophyll cell-1, converted to ph chlorophyll cell-1 (so the number is not as small) and divided by the surface area to give µg chlorophyll cm-2
