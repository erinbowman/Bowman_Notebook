# Protocol for Zooxanthellae Count of Adult Corals
### Lab Equipment
* Water Pick
* 100mL graduated cylinder
* 15mL centrifuge tube
* 5mL centrifuge tube
* Centrifuge
* Oven (for chlorophyll content)
* Pipette and bulb
* Vortex Mixer
* Haemocytometer and cover slip
* Compound microscope
* Click counter

####Prodcedure:

**Part 1: Remove tissue from coral skeleton:**
Use water pick loaded with seawater to blast the tissue and mucus from the skeleton of the coral in a container or plastic bag
Slowly move the water pick at a 45Â° angle to the coral for best tissue removal
Collect blastate water in the container/bag so that end volume may be recorded
Place clean skeleton in an oven for drying (necessary for determining surface area of the skeleton)
Pour the blastate into a 100mL graduated cylinder; also include the blastate left in the tube of the water pick
Record volume of blastate collected

**Part 2: Separation of zooxanthellae from coral tissue**
Pour a small sample of blastate into a 15mL centrifuge tube and a 5mL centrifuge tube
Centrifuge the blastate at high speed for two minutes
Decant the supernatant of coral tissue from both tubes and discard
Zooxanthellae pellet at base of centrifuge tube should be solidified, if it broke away when discarding supernatant, re-spin in centrifuge
Remove remaining supernatant ensuring not to disturb the zooxanthellae pellet
Place 5mL centrifuge tube containing zooxanthellae pellet aside for chlorophyll concentration analysis (chlorophyll content of zooxanthellae can be obtained using this protocol ->)

**Part 3: Counting zooxanthellae**
In 15mL centrifuge tube containing zooxanthellae pellet, add 1mL of filtered seawater to re-suspend the pellet
Mix on vortex mixer while tapping the base of the tube
Place cover slip on haemocytometer and add one drop of zooxanthellae suspension from 15mL centrifuge tube to either side
Observe the haemocytometer under the compound microscope at 4x magnification
On either side of the central well of the haemocytometer, locate grid of 9 large squares (1mm)
The three large squares on the right side and the three large squares on the left side that make up 6 of the 9 large squares each contains 16 medium sized squares (0.02cm)
The middle square of 9 should contain 25 medium squares that each contains 25 small squares (0.04cm)
The middle square in the top row and the middle square in the bottom row of 9 each contain 20 medium sized squares (0.02cm)
This specific configuration is dependent upon the exact haemocytometer brand used
Count the number of medium sized squares (0.02cm) in the middle large square that is needed to obtain a count of ~200 zooxanthellae
Use the click counter to count the zooxanthellae, take caution not to lose count
Repeat the procedure for the grid on the other side of the haemocytometer
By completing this process, there will be a total number of medium squares needed to reach ~400 zooxanthellae, which is the minimum required of an adequate sample size

**Part 4: Calculation of zooxanthellae number in sample**
Calculate the total volume (mL) in which ~400 zooxanthellae cells were counted (1mL=1cm3)
This volume should be the height from the haemocytometer grid to the cover slip multiplied by the area of the square being used to count - for instance - if height of coverslip on top of haemocytometer is 0.01cm, that will be multiplied by the area of the medium sized square which was used to count (0.01cm*0.02cm*0.02cm=4e-6cm3=4e-6mL)
Then take the total number of zooxanthellae/(the number of medium squares used * the volume per medium square which was just calculated) this is the concentration of zooxanthellae per mL
Concentration of zooxanthellae in the coral sample is found by dividing the original amount of blastate by the portion used for zooxanthellae counting (15mL)
That number multiplied by the concentration of zooxanthellae per mL is the concentration of zooxanthellae in the entire sample
The total number of zooxanthellae can be normalized by dividing the concentration by the surface area of that skeleton (surface area can be calculated by following this protocol ->) this will allow for zooxanthellae counts per unit surface area of the coral
