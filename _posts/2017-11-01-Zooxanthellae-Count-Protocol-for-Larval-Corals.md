# Protocol for Zooxanthellae Counts of Larval Corals
### Lab Equipment
* Pellet Pestle
* 15mL centrifuge tube
* Centrifuge
* Vortex mixer
* Haemocytometer and cover slip
* Compound microscope
* Click counter

#### Procedure:

**Part 1: Homogenize Larval Tissue**
Place larvae sample containing zooxanthellae into a 15mL centrifuge tube (20 larvae per sample)  
Homogenize the tissue using a pellet pestle  

**Part 2: Separation of zooxanthellae from larval tissue**
Centrifuge the tube at high speed for two minutes  
Decant the supernatant of tissue and discard  
Zooxanthellae pellet at base of centrifuge tube should be solidified, if it broke away when discarding supernatant, re-spin in centrifuge  
Remove remaining supernatant ensuring not to disturb the zooxanthellae pellet  

**Part 3: Counting zooxanthellae**
Resuspend the pellet in 200µL of filtered seawater  
Mix on vortex mixer while tapping the base of the tube  
Place cover slip on haemocytometer and add one drop of zooxanthellae suspension from 15mL centrifuge tube to either side   
Observe the haemocytometer under the compound microscope at 4x magnification  
On either side of the central well of the haemocytometer, locate grid of 9 large squares (1mm)  
The three large squares on the right side and the three large squares on the left side that make up 6 of the 9 large squares each contains 16 medium sized squares (0.02cm)  
The middle square of 9 should contain 25 medium squares that each contains 25 small squares (0.04cm)  
The middle square in the top row and the middle square in the bottom row of 9 each contain 20 medium sized squares (0.02cm)  
This specific configuration is dependent upon the exact haemocytometer brand used  
Count the number of medium sized squares (0.02cm) in the middle large square that is needed to obtain a count of ~200 zooxanthellae  
Use the click counter to count the zooxanthellae, take caution not to lose count  
Repeat the procedure for the grid on the other side of the haemocytometer  
By completing this process, there will be a total number of medium squares needed to reach ~400 zooxanthellae, which is the minimum required of an adequate sample size  

**Part 4: Calculation of zooxanthellae number in sample**
Calculate the total volume (mL) in which zooxanthellae cells were counted (1mL=1cm3)  
This volume should be the height from the haemocytometer grid to the cover slip multiplied by the area of the square being used to count - for instance - if height of coverslip on top of haemocytometer is 0.01cm, that will be multiplied by the area of the medium sized square which was used to count (0.01cm*0.02cm*0.02cm=4e-6cm3=4e-6mL)  
Then take the total number of zooxanthellae/(the number of medium squares used * the volume per medium square which was just calculated) this is the concentration of zooxanthellae per mL  
Concentration of zooxanthellae in the larval sample is found by dividing the zooxanthellae per mL by the volume of diluent used for zooxanthellae counting (200µL)   
That number divided by the number of larvae per sample (20) is zooxanthellae per larva  
Divide this concentration by the surface area of that larva (from the specific treatment on the specific day) this will allow for zooxanthellae counts per unit surface area of the larvae
